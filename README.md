# Ubees
## This was the very first application I created. It allows the user to buy and sell honey products. In the 6th semester of my computer science degree I was offered the course of Android development under the supervision of Jaleel Awan. It was my first experience of Android development and also I learned java for the first time as well. This course inspired me alot to pursue my final year project in android development. After that in 7th semester I started leaning #flutter for my final year project because it was leading technology.
This application was created using Java, XML, Firebase.
I want to show my gratitude towards Jaleel Awan who guide me and helped me to grow more.
